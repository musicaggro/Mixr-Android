# Mixr
Android music streaming App that allows users to search through SoundClouds database of songs and select a track for media playback.

Typing away during development this experience just confirmed my love for android, really nailing in my committed future to the app dev space!
Some of the features used here were enabled by a wide range of modern Android technologies such as,

- Working with the newer RecyclerView to display a list of tracks
- Implementing an ActionBar to be used in the main menu for search functionality
- Using Parcelable to pass a track object from the list activity to a MediaPlayer activity for playback
- Setting up the fantastic combination of RetroFit and GSON, to handle networking
- Structuring UI utilizing ConstraintLayout and RelativeLayout using XML
- Placing androidx.widget components for music player related functionality
